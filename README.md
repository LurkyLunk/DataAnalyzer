# Data Ingestion Service

This project is a Rust-based data ingestion service designed to efficiently collect, process, and store data from various sources in real-time. It utilizes asynchronous programming paradigms with the help of the Tokio runtime for high-volume data handling and is built with scalability and security in mind.

## Features

- **Asynchronous Data Processing**: Utilizes Rust's async/await features for non-blocking data processing.
- **Microservices Architecture**: Designed with microservices principles for enhanced scalability and maintainability.
- **Secure Communication**: Implements SSL/TLS for secure data transmission.
- **Database Optimization**: Features optimized database interactions for fast data storage and retrieval.
- **Data Observability**: Includes a built-in observability framework for real-time monitoring and alerting.
- **CI/CD Integration**: Ready for Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment pipelines for automated testing and deployment.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Rust and Cargo (latest stable version recommended)
- [Optional] Docker for containerization
- [Optional] Access to a database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB), if storing processed data

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

```sh
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/data_ingestion_service.git
cd data_ingestion_service
```

2. **Build the project:**

```sh
cargo build
```

3. **Run the service:**

```sh
cargo run
```

This will start the data ingestion service listening on `localhost:8080` by default.

### Configuration

- To change the default listening port or database connection settings, edit the configuration file located at `Config.toml` (sample path).

## Usage

After starting the service, it will begin listening for incoming data on the configured port. You can test the service using `curl`:

```sh
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"id": 1, "content": "test data"}' http://localhost:8080/data
```

## Testing

To run the integrated tests, use the following command:

```sh
cargo test
```

## Deployment

The service can be deployed using traditional methods or containerized using Docker. A sample `Dockerfile` is included for building a Docker image.

```Dockerfile
